3. Write a brief connection message that:
   - References something specific about their work/background
   - Mentions you're a CS student seeking internship guidance
   - Asks to connect (not for a job directly)
   - Feels genuine and non-pushy

"Hi [Name]! Your work on [specific project] at [company] looks incredible. I'm a CS student and honestly have no idea how you even approach problems like that. Would love to connect and maybe pick your brain sometime!"

"Hey! Fellow [university/background] person here. I've been following [company]'s work on [specific thing] and it's wild. I'm a CS student trying to break into [field] - any chance we could connect?"
